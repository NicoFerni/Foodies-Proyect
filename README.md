# Individual Project - Foodies

## Overview
In this app you can search recipes from the Spoonacular API, read the instructions, how to cook the recipe and see the health score.
in the back-end, i made a database to save the api information and, if the user wants, create his own recipe. 
Finally, in the front-end, I added some filters to make easier to search for an specific dish, I made cards to order the information and  added a form to 
create a recipe, with all the same fields that the originals recipies have.
